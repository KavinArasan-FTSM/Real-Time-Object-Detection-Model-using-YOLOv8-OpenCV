# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Model-using-YOLOv8-OpenCV
This project demonstrates the use of a real-time object detection system powered by YOLOv8 and optimized to run on GPU (CUDA) for high performance. The model detects and counts selected everyday objects. The solution achieves smooth real-time detection with stable counting and class filtering.
